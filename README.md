Bot for @OneADayActivism twitter account. This bot will post one action a day that anyone can do to support a cause. More explanation here: https://twitter.com/OneADayActivism/status/1270793440385613824.

Why? Well I often get overwhelmed by the number of things there are to fix in this world and always have a hard time sorting through possibilities to decide on which action to take. Each resource I find seems to have a list of "75 things to do", where each item is compiled of 8 different resources. It's a never-ending rabbit hole. As a result, I end up on an hours-long search, or doing little or nothing because I can't decide on the *best* thing to do. I decided to create a bot that will help me get past the decision paralysis. I made a list of the causes that are important to me and am curating a specific action list for each one. The bot will randomly choose an action and post it each day. 

If anyone wants to help with this project (you don't have to be a programmer to help!), let me know!
